# Fedora Setup

This is my private collection of scripts used to set up some things in fresh install of Fedora operating system. It is not recommended to use this for anything unless you know what you're doing.

Many of the scripts download non-free third party binaries. They are often suited to only be compatible with my RPi3 and astronomy equipment. Other scripts compile software which is not available in Fedora (such as DS9). If for some reason you still want to use any of this, you do that at your own responsibility.

Scripts with ``9xx`` prefix are considered obsolete.
